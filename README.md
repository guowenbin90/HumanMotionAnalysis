## Introduction<a name="Introduction"></a>
### Human movement study:
- Health sciences (biomechanics, kinesiology, neurology, sports medicine)
- Arts (theater and dance, cultural studies) 
- Intersection (arts in medicine, dance therapy) 

### Multi-modal datasets:
- Video
- Skeletal motion capture
- Manual annotations
- Clinical metadata

## Problem Statement <a name="Problem"></a>
Traditional Laban movement analysis (LMA):
- 4-dimensional features (shape, effort, space, body)
- Manual input from professionals
- Time-consuming
- Human errors

## Objective<a name="Objective"></a>
Creating automated Laban movement annotation:
- Training four different machine learning algorithms through supervised learning on existing human motion datasets of video and skeletal sequences 
- Test feature extraction methods (within and across frames) to improve the annotation accuracy 
- Input raw videos and export Laban annotated videos
